## Installation

Open up the terminal and enter "node index.js" into the command line to prompt the questions to begin.

## Usage

The user answers questions about the name of the manager, their ID number, their Email address, their office number, and then a list appears to ask if the user would like to add other staff members to the team or to finish building the team. This will either give them questions about the staff member they want to add, or will generate the HTML with the staff information."
